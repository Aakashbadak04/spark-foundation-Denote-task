                <p class="center">An old age home is a shelter that is home to the older and needy people who the family has abandoned. In old age homes, these people are taken care of the food, clothing and shelter. 
                    Also, they are given proper medical facilities. Much recreational and entertainment are also provided.

                <p class="center">a child whose parents have died, are unknown, or have permanently abandoned them.
                     In common usage, only a child who has lost both parents due to death is called an orphan.
                     Orphans can metaphorically search for self-understanding through attempting to know their roots. Parents can also be allies and sources of aid for children, and removing the parents makes the character's difficulties more severe. Parents, furthermore, can be irrelevant to the theme a writer is trying to develop
                     , and orphaning the character frees the writer from the necessity to depict such an irrelevant relationship</p>

                    in improving the physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual well-being. However, you need to do your research about the charitable organizations that share the same interest as yours.
